## Surf n'Shake
We've come up with a plan to open up a surf and Shake shop where we can serve up ice cream treats and surf boards on the beautiful island of Oahu. Mr. W. Avy has requested a weather data analysis to accompany the business plan that will show the weather trends in on the island.

## Results
After careful analysis, this is the difference we found between June and December. We chose these months because this is where we expected the greatest difference in recorded weather.

June
- Average temp: 74.9°
- Minimum temp: 64°
- Maximum temp: 85°
- 25% Chance Precipitation: 73
- 50% Chance Precipitation: 75
- 75% Chance Precipitation: 77

December
- Average temp: 71°
- Minimum temp: 56°
- Maximum temp: 83°
- 25% Chance Precipitation: 69
- 50% Chance Precipitation: 71
- 75% Chance Precipitation: 74

## Summary
As we can see, the temperature difference between the 2 months isn't that extreme. With the average and maximum temperatures only being 2°-4° apart, its hard to say that temperature would play a big role in business impact. We do see LESS preciptation across coverage percentages in December. So there is a good chance that the rainy summers could push customers inside the shop to enjoy what we have to offer. I would be interested to see if we could check the hurricane or tropical storms that are counted per month. That could be significant enough to impact our business during the season.
